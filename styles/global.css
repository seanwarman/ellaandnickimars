/* When it comes to styling the fonts add 
the exact fonts, sizes and weight of each 
font to the h tags and p tag so that you
don't have to add a class or anything for
the correct fonts, they'll just be globally
attached to the correct tag as default 

Currently the fonts are:

h1 - The main banner font "Building a Martian House"
h2 - "Project Partners and Funders" (also "Donate").
h3 - Elevator pitch font
h4 - "Project Timeline" text, this will be light weight
	 and also used for the side panel headings. (multi-sized)
h5 - Partner names (bold capitals).
h6 - This could be the quote font in italics (we'll 
	 make this multi-sized as it'll be used for the
	 conversation quote as well).

We might need a seperate class for the Ella&Nicki brand.
That's ok because it'll only be used once.
