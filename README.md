# Ella & Nicki

A mobile-first webpage built using React for Bristol artist's Ella & Nicki for their
10 year mars project.

Check out the site and consider donating to this exciting project:

This webpage was actually built using Redux, probably needlessly but I
actually find Redux is great for webpages that only need a few global values and 
it keeps the whole project nice and clean.

As you'll see from the code this app was built using webpack (rather than
react-create-app), this way I can go in and gzip the files if it's ever
needed in future.

Here's a link to Ella & Nicki's Wordpress blog:

You can also subscribe to their email list from the website, if you're
interested in keeping up to to date with them.
